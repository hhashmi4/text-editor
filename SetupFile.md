To setup we need to do a couple things
 - first we need a linux based machine or if you are on windows we need to have wsl or bash 
 - Then to run this run [sudo apt-get install gcc make]
 - Then to run [ cc kilo.c -o kilo] to create an output file which will be [./kilo]
 - since we have a make file we just need to run the command 'make' in the terminal every time we update our kilo.c file
